The analysis of the COVID-19 dataset involved extracting and examining data on deaths and vaccinations from the database. 

Key columns such as location, date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and population were selected for scrutiny. 

Death rates and case rates were calculated to gauge the severity of the pandemic across various locations, with a focus on identifying countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population. 

Additionally, the analysis pinpointed countries with the highest death counts overall and per continent. 

Trends in global new cases, new deaths, and death rates over time were assessed to understand the progression of the pandemic. 

Furthermore, the relationship between total population and total vaccinations was explored to assess vaccination efforts. 

Common Table Expressions (CTE) were employed to compute accumulated vaccinations over time for each location, while a temporary table was created to store percentage of population vaccinated data. 

Views were established for easier access to calculated metrics, facilitating subsequent data visualization endeavors. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into the spread of COVID-19 and the progress of vaccination campaigns globally.
