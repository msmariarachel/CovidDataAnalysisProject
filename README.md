Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
Determined countries with the highest death counts both overall and per continent.
Analyzed global trends in new cases, new deaths, and death rates over time.
Explored the relationship between total population and total vaccinations to assess vaccination progress.
Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTE) to calculate accumulated vaccinations over time for each location.
Created a temporary table to store percentage of population vaccinated data.
Developed views for easier access to calculated metrics for data visualization purposes.
